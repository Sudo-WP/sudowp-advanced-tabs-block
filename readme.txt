== Description ==

This is SudoWP Advanced Tabs Gutenberg Block, a community-maintained and security-hardened fork of the abandoned "Advanced Tabs Gutenberg Block" plugin.

**Advanced Tabs Block** is a custom Gutenberg Block developed with **Gutenberg Native Components**. You can easily showcase your contents in **Tabs Style** using this block. It has come with a lot of customization and styling options.

### Why this fork?
This plugin has been forked to ensure compatibility with PHP 8.2+ and to implement strict security hardening protocols. The original plugin had potential security gaps and outdated code structures.

### Security Patches in SudoWP Edition
*   **PHP 8.2 Compatibility:** Full refactoring for PHP 8.2 strict types and deprecation fixes.
*   **Security Hardening:** Implementation of strict input sanitization, output escaping, and nonce verification.
*   **Architecture Modernization:** Refactored codebase to use modern OOP standards (Singleton pattern, Namespaces).
